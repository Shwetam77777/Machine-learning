# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms & Implementations

> **"A comprehensive collection of Machine Learning models, ranging from classical regression to NLP and Neural Network foundations."**

### 📂 Repository Overview
This repository serves as a code bank for various Machine Learning algorithms. It includes implementations using **Scikit-Learn** as well as logic built from **scratch** to understand the mathematics behind the models.

### 🧠 Key Areas Covered

#### 1. Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
* **Regression:** Simple Linear Regression (`SLR`), Multiple Linear Regression (`MLR`), Polynomial Regression.
* **Classification:** Naive Bayes (Gaussian & Bernoulli), K-Nearest Neighbors (`KNN`), Decision Trees.
* **Mathematical Foundations:** Sigmoid Function, Softmax Function (implemented from scratch).

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction
* **Clustering:** Hierarchical Clustering.
* **Feature Engineering:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Dummy Variable Trap handling.

#### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Twitter Sentiment Analysis, VADER Sentiments, Sarcasm Detection.
* **Text Processing:** Count Vectorizer, Word Counter, Bag of Words techniques.

#### 4. Model Evaluation & Tuning
* **Optimization:** Grid Search, K-Fold Cross Validation.
* **Preprocessing:** Min-Max Scaling, Label Encoding, Train-Test Splits.
* **Deployment:** Saving and Loading models (Pickle/Joblib).
